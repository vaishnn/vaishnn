Hi there, I'm Vaishnav Pratap! 👋

I'm a data enthusiast and problem solver with a background in Mechanical Engineering, passionate about leveraging data to build innovative solutions. I enjoy diving into complex datasets, uncovering insights, and creating applications that make a real-world impact.
👨‍💻 About Me

I'm currently a final year Mechanical Engineering student at Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur. My journey has taken me from designing 3D models and understanding the mechanics of things to building intelligent systems with data. I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn new technologies.

    🔧 Transitioning from Atoms to Bits: My mechanical engineering background gives me a unique perspective on systems, optimization, and problem-solving, which I now apply to the world of data.

    📊 Data-Driven Decision Making: I have hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning, and developing optimization algorithms. I've worked on projects ranging from forecasting fast-food orders to optimizing maritime logistics.

    ☁️ Cloud Enthusiast: I'm experienced in deploying and managing applications on cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Oracle Cloud.

🚀 What I'm Currently Working On

I'm building a Steam Game Recommendation System. This full-stack project aims to provide personalized game recommendations to Steam users based on their gaming history and preferences.

    Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, Streamlit, BeautifulSoup, REST API), AWS (RDS with MariaDB, EC2), and Oracle Cloud (Compute Instance).
